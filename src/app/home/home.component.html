<p>Angular is a platform and framework for building client-side applications using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript/JavaScript. Developed and maintained by Google, Angular provides a powerful set of tools to create dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs) and is widely used for developing enterprise-scale web applications.</p>

    <h2>Key Features of Angular</h2>

    <h3>1. Component-Based Architecture</h3>
    <p>Angular applications are built using components, which encapsulate the logic and UI.</p>
    <p>Components are reusable, making it easier to manage and maintain the codebase.</p>
    <p>A component is made up of a template (HTML), a class (TypeScript), and styles (CSS).</p>

    <h3>2. TypeScript</h3>
    <p>Angular is built using TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript that includes static typing, classes, and interfaces, helping catch errors early and enabling better code quality and maintainability.</p>

    <h3>3. Two-Way Data Binding</h3>
    <p>Data binding allows synchronization of data between the model (data) and the view (UI).</p>
    <p>Two-way binding means that changes in the view reflect in the model, and changes in the model reflect in the view.</p>

    <h3>4. Directives</h3>
    <p>Directives are special markers in the DOM that tell Angular to attach specific behavior to an element or modify the DOM structure.</p>
    <p>Examples include structural directives like <code>*ngIf</code> and <code>*ngFor</code>, which control element rendering.</p>

    <h3>5. Dependency Injection (DI)</h3>
    <p>Angular uses dependency injection to provide services or other dependencies to components and other parts of the application, improving modularity and testability.</p>
    <p>This allows Angular to manage the lifecycle of services and objects, reducing boilerplate code.</p>

    <h3>6. Routing</h3>
    <p>Angularâ€™s router enables navigation between views or pages in the application, allowing users to navigate seamlessly without page reloads (SPA behavior).</p>
    <p>It supports lazy loading, which can load parts of the app on demand, improving performance.</p>

    <h3>7. RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript)</h3>
    <p>RxJS is used for managing asynchronous operations in Angular. It enables reactive programming, making it easier to handle events, data streams, and asynchronous logic using Observables.</p>

    <h3>8. Forms</h3>
    <p>Angular supports both template-driven and reactive forms, allowing developers to handle user input and validation effectively.</p>
    <p>Reactive forms provide a more robust way to manage complex form logic and validation.</p>

    <h3>9. Testing</h3>
    <p>Angular includes testing frameworks such as Jasmine and Karma to help developers write unit and end-to-end tests.</p>
    <p>It also supports mock services and DI for testing various parts of an application.</p>

    <h3>10. CLI (Command-Line Interface)</h3>
    <p>Angular CLI is a powerful tool that allows developers to create, build, test, and deploy Angular applications.</p>
    <p>It automates tasks like project setup, code generation, and testing, improving productivity.</p>

    <h3>11. Internationalization (i18n)</h3>
    <p>Angular provides built-in support for internationalization, allowing applications to support multiple languages and regional formats.</p>

    <h2>Benefits of Using Angular</h2>
